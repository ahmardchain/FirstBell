## Design Read

- Artifact: responsive landing and separate `/app` research workspace.
- Audience: newcomers exploring tokenized equities.
- Mode: preserve the product name and real token assets; overhaul the marketing composition.
- Visual variance: 5/10; motion: 2/10; density: 5/10; asset dependence: 7/10; brand fidelity: 8/10.

## Design decisions

- Material: digital ink and white paper. Composition: editorial with asymmetric explanatory sections and one dense asset directory. Structure: Swiss grid with sharp rules and zero radius. Feeling: precise, candid, confident.
- Palette: near-black `#080808`, true white `#fff`, gray rules and type. Light surfaces are white, without cream or milk tones. Transparent company marks keep their authentic color inside raised, softly rounded hero tiles. The issuer token assets remain separate from the company marks.
- Typography: Inter variable for display/body, IBM Plex Mono for labels and technical identifiers. Chinese uses the platform CJK sans fallback.
- Spacing: generous section padding, tight technical rows, compact navigation. Borders carry section separation; the floating hero tiles are the single elevated surface.
- Motion: floating hero tiles, a restrained logo loop, and React Bits Scroll Float on editorial headings and the footer statement. No scroll prompts, ornamental parallax, or forced smooth scrolling. Respect reduced motion.
- Product contract: the App link opens `/app`. Home provides a searchable, saveable index and asset files; Trade shows the proposed path without accepting payments; Agent answers fixed source questions; Portfolio shows locally saved assets, not wallet holdings. No invented prices or execution claims.

## App direction

- Reference: Daybreak's catalog hierarchy and mobile navigation supplied by the user. FirstBell uses its own black/white editorial system, original mark and source-backed Ondo assets.
- Home: dotted true-white or near-black canvas, large monochrome feature, compact square asset cards with transparent company marks. Inter is the display/body face and IBM Plex Mono identifies contracts, labels, and chain records.
- Desktop: compact top navigation. Mobile: four-item persistent bottom navigation, exactly Home, Trade, Agent, Portfolio in English; responsive Chinese labels.
- Motion: brief card entrances and a floating feature mark; reduced-motion users get static presentation. Sharp borders carry structure; no fabricated chart or price.

The mark provenance is in `brand-mark-sources.json`. The floating icon component lives at `components/ui/floating-icons-hero-section.tsx`. React Bits adaptations live at `components/ui/logo-loop.tsx` and `components/ui/scroll-float.tsx`, with a license notice in `third_party/REACT_BITS_LICENSE.md`.
