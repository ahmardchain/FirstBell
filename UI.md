## Design Read

- Artifact: responsive landing and research index.
- Audience: newcomers exploring tokenized equities.
- Mode: preserve the product name and real token assets; overhaul the marketing composition.
- Visual variance: 5/10; motion: 2/10; density: 5/10; asset dependence: 7/10; brand fidelity: 8/10.

## Design decisions

- Material: digital ink and white paper. Composition: editorial with asymmetric explanatory sections and one dense asset directory. Structure: Swiss grid with sharp rules and zero radius. Feeling: precise, candid, confident.
- Palette: near-black `#080808`, true white `#fff`, gray rules and type. Light surfaces are white, without cream or milk tones. Transparent company marks keep their authentic color inside raised, softly rounded hero tiles. The issuer token assets remain separate from the company marks.
- Typography: Inter variable for display/body, IBM Plex Mono for labels and technical identifiers. Chinese uses the platform CJK sans fallback.
- Spacing: generous section padding, tight technical rows, compact navigation. Borders carry the separation; no card shadows or glass.
- Motion: floating hero tiles and a restrained logo loop. No scroll prompts, scroll reveals, ornamental parallax, or forced smooth scrolling. Respect reduced motion.
- Product contract: the App link opens a searchable on-page asset index. It shows source-backed identifiers and links; no transactional controls or invented prices.
